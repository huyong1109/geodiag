<h1>Update GEODIAG</h1>
<p>
	GEODIAG is version controlled by <b>git</b>. Because it will be continuously
	developed by the community members, update will be very frequent. Thus, in
	order to make the update process transparent to the users who are not
	familiar with <b>git</b>, the following command has been cast:
	<div class="command_example">
		$ geodiag update
	</div>
	The subcommand update works <b>only if</b> the GEODIAG was got by using git!
</p>
<p>
	<div class="notice">Under construction</div>
</p>
