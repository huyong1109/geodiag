<h1>Update GEODIAG</h1>
<p>
	GEODIAG is version controlled by <b>git</b>. Because it will be continuously
	developed by the community members, update will be very frequent. Thus, in
	order to make the update process transparent to the users who are not
	familiar with <b>git</b>, the following command has been cast:
	<div class="command_example">
		$ geodiag update
	</div>
	The subcommand update works <b>only if</b> the GEODIAG was got by using git!
</p>
<h1>Run Diagnostics Packages</h1>
<p>
    GEODIAG is enriched with plenty (at least should be) of diagnostics
    packages (e.g. MJO). You can check out what packages are available by:
    <div class="command_example">
        $ geodiag list
    </div>
    These packages can help the researchers get the results quickly and easily,
    and can be used as the post-processing of models. All you need to do is
    calling one or several commands as following (of course, you need to
    prepare the data!):
    <div class="command_example">
        $ geodiag run &ltpackage&gt [&ltpackage options&gt]
    </div>
    You can get the necessary options specific to a package by:
    <div class="command_example">
        $ geodiag help &ltpackage&gt
    </div>
</p>
<p>
	<div class="notice">Under heavy construction</div>
</p>
