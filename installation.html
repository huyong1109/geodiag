	configuration file. The following is just an example in .bashrc:
	<p class="command_example">
		source &ltpath_to_GEODIAG&gt/setup.sh
	</p>
	This will put the <b>&ltpath_to_GEODIAG&gt</b> into PATH, set the environment variables
	(e.g., <b>GEODIAG_ROOT</b>), build necessary components, and setup auto-completion.
