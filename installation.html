    Download package from <a
            href="https://github.com/lasg-model/geodiag/zipball/master">here</a>
    or clone the git repository as
	<p class="command_example">
		$ git clone https://github.com/lasg-model/geodiag.git
	</p>
	<p class="notice">
        It is recommended to use git way to get GEODIAG! By this way, you can
        use the <b>update</b> subcommand to keep GEODIAG up to date easily.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	Install GEODIAG is easy as breeze by just sourcing the "setup.sh" in BASH
	configuration file. The following is just an example in .bashrc:
	<p class="command_example">
		source &ltpath_to_GEODIAG&gt/setup.sh
	</p>
    <p class="notice">
        For Linux newbie, &ltpath_to_GEODIAG&gt is the directory where you put
        GEODIAG, e.g. /opt/geodiag, so change it please!
    </p>
    This will put the <b>&ltpath_to_GEODIAG&gt</b> into PATH, set the
    environment variables (e.g., <b>GEODIAG_ROOT</b>), and setup
    auto-completion. Next some tool components (e.g. EEMD) written in C or
    other languages should be built by running:
    <p class="command_example">
    	$ geodiag warmup
    </p>
    <p class="notice">
        Previously, this build stage is in setup.sh, but some user reported the
        echo command caused problem with <b>scp</b>, so I moved it into
        <b>warmup</b> subcommand.
