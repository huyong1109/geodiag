<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>
	In geosciences (e.g., atmospheric science), there are plenty of phenomena
	(add some pages about them) that reveal the magics and beauty of the
	nature. In the daily research, those phenomena have to be diagnosed from
	several sources of data, such as observation data and climate model output.
	Sometimes, the diagnosing methods are not that easy to implement from
	scratch, and it is also not necessary to create wheels thousands of times.
	In order to boost the efficiency of researches, we would like to integrate
	the works of different people. This should construct a well designed
	software framework to organize the scripts (e.g.,
	<a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/">NCL</a>
	scripts) and tools together, and provide a friendly user interface.
