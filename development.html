	<h1>1. Diagnostics package development</h1>
	<p>
        Currently a <a
            href="https://github.com/lasg-model/geodiag/tree/master/packages/mjo"><b>MJO</b></a>
        diagnostics package is under development. Although there exists a <a
            href="http://climate.snu.ac.kr/mjo_diagnostics/index.htm">version</a>,
        this package will be easier to use (No C shell scripts!) with just one
        command to run all or parts of the three levels. So it will definitely
        alleviate the burden of model development and evaluation. This package
        will follow the standard diagnostics procedures of US-CLIVAR MJO
        working group.

    Indian ocean averaged OLR from model results.<br/>
