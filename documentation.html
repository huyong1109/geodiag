<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>
	GEODIAG can be used as a CUI/GUI application by calling the corresponding
	interface, or be used as a NCL script library by loading the scripts.
</p>
<h1>2. CUI usage</h1>
<h1>3. Library usage</h1>
<p>
	Several useful NCL functions or procedures are written for researchers who need to cast a NCL script by themself. For the time being, users can load the script as:
	<div class="text_example">
		load "$GEODIAG_UTILS/geodiag_plot_utils.ncl"
	</div>
	<h1>3.1 Plot China map</h1>
	<p>
		The calling pattern is as following example:
		<div class="text_example">
			res = True<br>
			<font color="red">set_china_map(res) ; ---------- # 1</font><br>
			... ; other plotting resources<br>
			plot = ... ; plot the figure<br>
			<font color="red">
			config = True<br>
			config@gdShowProvince = False<br>    ; ---------- # 3
			draw_china_map(wks, plot, config)    ; ---------- # 2
			</font>
		</div>
		The #1 statement will set the range of lat-lon coordinates, and some
		other basic setup of a map. Some configurations can be set like #2
		statement. The #3 statement will draw the China map onto the base plot,
		which can be just a map or any other plot like contours. The figure
		without real content is as:<br>
		<img src="assets/pictures/china_map.png" alt="China map"
		width="600"/><br>
		<div class="notice">
			For the time being, the small map of South China Sea will not be
			filled by any content (e.g., contours). This can be improved by any
			one who want to contribute!
		</div>
		For curious users, the internal NCL scripts can be viewed
